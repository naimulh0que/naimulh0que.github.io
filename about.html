                <h1>Bio</h1>
                <p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the College of Information Studies (iSchool), University of Maryland, College Park.
                    I work with 
                    <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~elm/">Professor Niklas Elmqvist</a> and 
                    am a member of the <a href="https://hcil.umd.edu">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a>. 
                    Previously, I obtained a Master's in Computer Science from Stony Brook University
                    and a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
                    My official first name is Md Naimul, but you can call me Naimul (pronunciation: na-ei-mul).
                    Md stands for Mohammod, a common name in Bangladesh. It is so common that at some point,
                    we started using the short form!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My broad research interests are Human-Computer Interaction, Data Visualization, and Human-Centered AI. More specifically, I study how data visualization can help 
                    us to design <b> AI-infused supertools</b>, 
                    applications that amplify, augment, empower, and enhance human performance, by combining user experiences with AI support services.
                    I argue that interactive visualization can work as a communication medium between humans and AI and help us retain human agency and ownership in AI-infused supertools.
                    To validate this premise, during my dissertation, I designed three AI-assisted writing tools (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13057.pdf">HaLLMark</a>, 
                    <a href="./docs/dramatVis.pdf">DramatVis Personae</a>, and <a href="./docs/dis23-42.pdf">Portrayal</a>),
                    to study how visualization and AI can amplify creative writing while retaining writersâ€™ agency and ownership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also design interactive visualization techniques that can adapt to large-scale data and models.
                    For example, during my dissertation, I designed <a href="https://browse.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02764.pdf">Aggregate Query Sculpting (AQS)</a> for iteratively exploring large-scale multivariate data
                        and <a href="./docs/vcp.pdf">Visual Concept Programming</a> for summarizing and programming image datasets.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I am determined to ensure equal access to data and tools for everyone. 
                    As a starting point, we recently proposed a sonification method (<a href="./docs/chi23-404.pdf">Accessible Data Visualization</a>) 
                    so that blind users can access charts and data. Please see my publication list below for more details.
